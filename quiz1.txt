1. Explain Big Data and the five V's of big data?

Big data is any data which cannot fit in memory and requires distributed computing to manage and
analyse. The five V's are:
Volume - the amount of data
Velocity - the speed at which data is coming in
Variety - the sources of data and its structure; structured, semi structured and unstructured.
Veracity - the quality of data
Value - the business insight which could be gained from the data

2. What is a checkpoint in Hadoop?

a periodic file system metadata merge of the namenode which merges fsimage file with metadata 
edits file.

3. What is the difference between an HDFS Block and an Input Split?

a HDFS Block is the physical representation of data in Hadoop. Input Split is the map reduce
logical representation of data present in the block.

4. Explain the difference between NameNode, Backup Node and Checkpoint NameNode?

The NamenNode holds metadata for the cluster and decides on how a file is distributed across 
the cluster. Backup Node provides check pointing functionality and is in sync with the NameNode
it also maintains its up to date in memory copy of the file system namespace.
The Checkpoint node keeps track of latest checkpoint in a directory by downloading the edits file
and the fsimage file from the namenode and merging it locally to keep track of the namespace.

5. HDFS architecture?

HDFS follows a master/slave architecture where one node acts as the master (namenode) and all other
nodes act as slaves (datanodes). A secondary namenode exists for fault tolerance.

6. Explain the 3 stages of MapReduce?

The MapReduce paradigm consists of a mapper stage taking data and creating key value pairs
and a reducer stage which carries out transformations on the data. Prior to the reducer phase
the data is shuffled to bring all the keys together in order to speed up transformations.
